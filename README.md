# Workers' Compensation Data (Qld - Australia)

## Introduction
This is data relating to workers' compensation in Queensland and I am learning how to do data projects.

Firstly I will conduct some EDA, draw some graphs, and then if I obtain the skills I will conduct some machine learning.

I need firstly to identify what could be interesting to analyse.

Data obtained from [Queensland Government](https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/office-of-fair-and-safe-work-workers-compensation-injury-data-lodged-from-2010-11-to-2012-13)
